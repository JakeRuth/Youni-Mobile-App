# Youni-Mobile-App

This app is no longer on the app store.  I have a video of the live app on my personal website, I encourage you to check it out: http://jakeruth.com/#portfolio-link

This app is created with React Native.  Xcode was used (forced to be used) to manage the builds and was the 'middleman'
to upload mobile app binaries to the app store.

When I first started this repo I was completely new to React Native.  Over time the code base began to mature as well as it could in a
fast pace start up environment.  It's important to note that a lot of the features in this app were prototyped very quickly.  Although
there is never an excuse to not test software, I just simply couldn't justify adding Mocha/Chai etc. test framework to this project for
a flaundering start up that needed new features or faced death.

This app performed very well for IOS, I am proud of the scale and complexity it reached. Also for what it's worth many people did enjoy
using the application and it has some pretty complex UI components which give the user an enriched 'swipeful' experience.
